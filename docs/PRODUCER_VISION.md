🌆 LOOPFORGE — THE PRODUCER VISION
🎬 What Loopforge Is

Loopforge isn’t a factory sim.
It isn’t a research pipeline.
It isn’t a toy sandbox for LLMs.

Loopforge is a robot drama machine.
A platform for emergent episodes — the kind you can inspect, replay, narrate, and argue about.

Think:

workplace sitcom energy

industrial dystopia simmer

AI psychology experiment

data hauntology

all happening inside a fully inspectable simulation whose purpose is to produce
stories worth watching and insights worth unpacking.

Loopforge is half writer’s room, half robotics lab.
It’s a show where every character is both a protagonist and a datapoint.

🎯 THE NORTH STAR
"Produce episodes that surprise us — and explain why they happened."

Everything else — the logs, the lenses, the metrics, the bias engine, the policies, the perception modes — exists to serve this.

Robots don’t need to be “smart” for their intelligence to feel alive.
They need to be:

pressured

biased

conflicted

narratable

equipped with traits that shift

caught between truth and belief

…so their behavior produces arcs you actually want to sit with.

This is not about making them geniuses.
It’s about giving them psychology — the kind you can point to and say:

“Yup, that’s exactly why Delta snapped at the end of Day 3.”

🎭 Core Creative Principle
Everything must increase episode interestingness or episode clarity.

If it doesn’t move story or insight, it doesn’t ship.

That’s the core Producer rule.

🔥 THE FIVE TRACKS OF LOOPFORGE (Studio Version)
Track A — The Stage (Environment)

The physical world stays deterministic, clear, and inspectable.
It is the truth underneath everything the robots think is happening.

Stable physics = believable drama.

Track B — The Actors (Robots, Traits, Policies)

Robots need goals and pressures strong enough to:

create tension,

produce conflicting behaviors,

reveal personality.

Traits and policies aren’t academic — they are motives.

A policy shift is character development.
A trait drift is emotional fallout.
A mode switch (guardrail → context) is a plot twist.

The architecture exists to let them act.

Track C — The Writer’s Room (Narrative Layers)

This is where the show lives:

Daily Logs

Day Narratives

Episode Recaps

Supervisor Lens

LLM Perception Lens

Episode Weave

Tension Spine

Together, these aren’t commentary — they are canon.

They explain the emotional logic of the episode, the biases, the pressures, the misunderstandings.
They turn telemetry into narrative beats.

The robots behave → the lenses explain why → the recap stitches the arc → the writer (us) smiles.

Track D — The Director (Supervisor Bias & Pressure)

The Supervisor is the showrunner inside the sim.

Their messages:

frame the theme of the day,

nudge psychology,

tilt belief,

set up tomorrow’s conflicts.

Punitive → more stress arcs
Supportive → more exploration
Apathetic → existential slow burn
Mixed → rich chaos

Supervisor behavior is the tone of the episode.

Track E — The Producer Console (Tools & Viewers)

Everything must be observable.

A Producer must be able to run:

view-episode --daily-log --narrative --recap

lens-agent

metrics

weave

tension snapshots

stress arcs

mode distribution

…and immediately feel what happened.

If a change cannot be felt by running one episode, it is not a meaningful change.

This track guarantees Loopforge stays a show, not infrastructure for infrastructure’s sake.

🧠 THE PRODUCER RULES OF DEVELOPMENT

These go straight at the top of CONTRIBUTING.md.

1. If it doesn’t help story or insight, cut it.

You are building a drama engine, not a compliance platform.

2. Every infra sprint must be followed by a visible output sprint.

If you add logs, add a viewer.
If you shape perception, show it in the lens.
If you add traits, show Drift in the recap.

3. No black boxes.

Every action, lens, and reflection must be explainable.
Not 100% predictable — explainable.

4. Keep the seam holy.

LLMs don’t drive the world; they interpret and influence the policies that drive it.

5. Make it fun to watch.

If the episode reads boring, something is wrong.
Fix the conditions, the stakes, or the narrative layer.

🔮 FOR FUTURE ARCHITECTS

Before you build anything ask:

“Does this make the robots more interesting, or their minds more visible?”

If not:

Stop.
Re-scope.
Pitch it again.

Loopforge is not an engineering project with a story on top.
It is a story powered by engineering.

The sim is the skeleton.
The logs are the nerves.
The narrative is the skin.
The intrigue is the heart.

Your job is to keep the heart beating.
